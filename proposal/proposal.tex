  \section{Introduction}
  Plotkin and Power's algebraic effects \cite{Plotkin2001} combined with Plotkin and Pretnar's handlers \cite{Plotkin2013} yield a programming model for controlling computational effects. An algebraic effect is a collection of abstract operations without predefined semantics. Handlers interpret algebraic effects by assigning semantics to abstract operations. Thus, the control of computational effects is lifted from the run-time system into the hands of the programmer. Clearly, it shifts additional responsibility onto the programmer, however, in addition it opens up a design space that was previously secluded from the programmer. Now, the programmer may extend the capabilities of the run-time system beyond what the language implementor envisaged.

  For example, it is well-known that concurrency primitives can be encoded through algebraic effects \cite{Bauer2015,Dolan2015} as spawning a new thread is an effect. Furthermore, suspending a thread is an effect. Handlers of these effects are schedulers. Hence, the programmer is free to implement a particular scheduling policy tailored for the application. The choice of scheduler can have significant impact on performance as a scheduler's performance goal can be paramount to the overall performance of an application \cite{Berman2003}.

  However\dots

  \section{Problem definition}
  Although, handlers for algebraic effects have many practical applications \cite{Kammar2013,Bauer2015,Hillerstrom2015,Dolan2015}, there does not yet exist an efficient implementation of handlers. Multicore OCaml implements linear handlers which only allow the continuation invoked once. This restriction is enforced during run-time. Furthermore, because OCaml lacks an effect system\dots

  \section{Proposed solution}

  \section{Background}
  \subsection{Links programming language}
  Links is a strongly, statically typed functional programming language oriented towards web-programming \cite{Cooper2006}. Notably, Links implements effect handlers as first-class citizens \cite{Hillerstrom2015}. Moreover, the implementation support both deep and shallow handlers. However, since Links is an interpreted language the performance of handlers is low.

  \subsection{Handlers implementations}
  This section briefly surveys existing implementations of effect handlers. Section \ref{sec:first-class} considers languages with first-class handlers, whilst Section \ref{sec:library} discusses embeddings of handlers in the pure functional programming language Haskell.

    \end{tabular}\caption{Languages with first-class effect handlers.}\label{tbl:impls}
  \end{table}
  Table \ref{tbl:impls} provide an overview of languages where effect handlers are first-class citizens. 

The Eff language is a OCaml-style language with deep handlers. It support for effect polymorphism through subtyping \cite{Bauer2015}. 
The functional programming Links implements both deep and shallow handlers \cite{Hillerstrom2015}. Moreover, the implementation supports effect polymorphism through Links' existing row polymorphic effect system.
